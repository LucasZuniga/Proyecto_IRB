abstract="The RoboCupJunior division of RoboCup is now entering its third year of international participation and is growing rapidly in size and popularity. This paper first outlines the history of the Junior league, since it was demonstrated in Paris at RoboCup 1998, and describes how it has evolved into the international sensation it is today. While the popularity of the event is self-evident, we are working to identify and quantify the educational benefits of the initiative. The remainder of the paper focuses on describing our efforts to encapsulate these qualities, highlighting results from a pilot study conducted at RoboCupJunior 2000 and presenting new data from a subsequent study of RoboCupJunior 2001.",

ABSTRACT = {Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the potential effect of educational robots, but what appears to be missing is an up-to-date and thorough review of the learning effectiveness of educational robots and the various influencing factors. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to systematically synthesize studies’ findings on the effects of educational robots on students’ learning outcomes. After searching for randomized studies describing educational robots interventions to improve learning outcomes, 34 effect sizes described in 17 articles met the selection criteria. The results of our work evidence a moderate but significantly positive effect of educational robots on learning outcomes (g  =  0.57, 95% CI [0.49, 0.65], p  <  0.00001). Moreover, moderator analyses were conducted to investigate important factors relating to the variation of the impact, including educational level and assessment type. Based on the findings of this study, we provide researchers and practitioners with insights into what characteristics of educational robot interventions appear to benefit students’ learning outcomes and how pedagogical approaches can be applied in various educational settings to guide the design of future educational robot interventions.},
